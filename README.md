<h1>Lattice-Based Encryption Ã— Code-Based Error Correction: A Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithm</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This repository contains the implementation of a quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm developed to secure communications in resource-constrained environments, such as IoT devices. 
        Our solution combines <strong>Lattice-Based Encryption</strong> and <strong>Code-Based Error Correction</strong> to create a lightweight, efficient, and secure encryption mechanism. 
        This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods to withstand potential quantum computer attacks while ensuring reliability in noisy communication channels.
